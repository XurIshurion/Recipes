Homemade Lasagna Recipe
Ingredients:

1 pound ground beef   
1 pound Italian sausage, casings removed
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (15-ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 cup olive oil
12 lasagna noodles
15 ounces ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese
Instructions:

Make the meat sauce: In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat. Drain off any excess grease. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until softened. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, thyme, red pepper flakes, and olive oil. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook for 1 hour, or until thickened.
Cook the noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
Prepare the ricotta mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, and pepper.
Assemble the lasagna: In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.   
Bake: Cover with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated 375°F (190°C) oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until bubbly and the cheese is golden brown.   
Let it rest: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.   
Enjoy your homemade lasagna!

Tips:

For a richer flavor, use a combination of ground beef and pork.
Add a splash of red wine to the meat sauce for extra depth of flavor.
You can also use no-boil lasagna noodles for a quicker preparation time.
